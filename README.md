# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Application using AWS CodePipeline & CodeBuild

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement a CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment) pipeline for a Node.js application using AWS Developer Tools.

The pipeline automatically:

* Pulls source code from GitHub
* Builds the application using AWS CodeBuild
* Deploys updates automatically after every code change

---

# 🧰 AWS Services Used

* AWS CodePipeline
* AWS CodeBuild
* Amazon EC2
* GitHub

# ⚙️ Features

✅ Automated CI/CD pipeline
✅ GitHub integration
✅ Automatic build process
✅ Continuous deployment workflow
✅ No manual deployment required

---

# 💻 Node.js Application

## 🟢 app.js

```javascript id="jlwmnr"
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.write("Deployed via CI/CD 🚀");
  res.end();
}).listen(3000);

console.log("Server running on port 3000");
```

---

# 📦 package.json

```json id="mjlwmnr"
{
  "name": "cicd-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  }
}
```

---

# ⚙️ buildspec.yml

```yaml id="njlwmnr"
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 18

  build:
    commands:
      - echo "Building application..."

  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo "Deployment completed"
```

---

# ⚙️ Deployment Workflow

## 1️⃣ Push Code to GitHub

```bash id="ojlwmnr"
git add .
git commit -m "Updated Node.js app"
git push
```

---

## 2️⃣ CodePipeline Automatically Triggers

* Source stage pulls code from GitHub

---

## 3️⃣ CodeBuild Executes Build

* Application build process starts automatically

---

## 4️⃣ Deployment Completes

* Updated application becomes available
